# Scouter

Scouter is an app to help people navigate the confusing and chaotic world of e-scooters and e-bikes. I developed an app that plotted Bird, Lime, Jump, and Lyft scooters and bikes in the Los Angeles area. Obtaining access to the location APIs of each scooter was quite an adventure. I emailed City Council, who made location API access a necessary part of approving scooter programs, pretending to study scooter movement and got access to Lime's API. I found Bird's location API on another github page, and I found Jump and Lyft's by monitoring the packets coming from my phone to the internet when I launched their apps. This also involved a little guess work, but it ultimately worked out. Sadly, most of the companies have changed their API systems at this point, but I've included a screenshot of what the app looked like when it was working. I stopped working on the app when I discovered that I had been beat to market by another app.
